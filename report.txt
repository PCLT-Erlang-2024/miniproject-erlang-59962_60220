In our implementation, the user starts by chosing the task
he wants to execute, followed by the number of trucks and
their size, then the execution is separated between each task.

task 1: We start by creating the conveyors and the trucks,
    each group being a thread and a cluster server. From now on each 1/5 of a second a new package is
    sent to the conveyors cluster, where its sent to the corresponding truck.

task 2: receives an extra input for each package max size.
    The execution is the same as task 1 with the extra of
    each package having a random size when creating them.

task 3: also receives as input the maximum time of each
    truck while "traveling". The execution is the same
    as the task before but the truck is kept allocated while sleeps for
    a random time simulating the travel.

The conveyors keep getting new packages while the truck is still dealing with the previous one.
